[DEPENDENCIES]

You need the stage 2 kernal files "m_flash.*" that are shipped with the official Spansion (Fujitsu) FR programmer.
You can download a free copy from www.spansion.com for example:
http://www.spansion.com/pages/emeaDisclaimer.aspx?forwardto=%2Fmarketingdownloads%2Fsw_utilities%2Fflash_programmer_fr%2Ffj_pc_programmer%2Fv01l28%2Fpcwfr-v01l28.zip

Copy stage 2 files to folder 'kernal32/'.
$ cp /c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/FUJITSU/FUJITSU\ FLASH\ MCU\ Programmer/FR/m_flash.* ./kernal32/

Copy the chipdef.ini file to 'chipdef32.ini' in the same folder as the executable.
$ cp /c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/FUJITSU/FUJITSU\ FLASH\ MCU\ Programmer/FR/chipdef.ini chipdef32.ini

[BUILDING]

Use GNU make to build the application.
Compiles for Windows XP and up in MinGW, I use vanilla MSys + MinGW setup.
Compiles with clang or gcc on most Linux/BSD platforms.

First clean any old objects and compiled resources:
$ make clean

To clean better i.e. remove most temporary files and compiled resources:
$ make mrproper

To view what files will be built and linked:
$ make info

Then compile and link in one step:
$ make

For a verbose build output just define AT as an empty token at the command line. For example:
$ make AT=

To run the application and print out basic help:
$ ./kuji32.exe -h

Build the documentation into a HTML page (html/index.html):
$ make doc

To clean up everything in the source tree (before commit):
$ make distclean

To create a ZIP containing the source, freshly built executable and HTML documentation:
$ make dist
